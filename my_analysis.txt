Description of files:
1. driver.py: This file contains the driver code which implements 3 functions, namely:

(a) main(): To control flow of execution.
(b) take_input(): To take input from the console. 
(c) validate_data(): To validate that the input is correct/legal.
(d) beam_verification(): To implement the beam verification, which is the main function of interest to us.

2. moment.py: This module needs to be included in the driver.py script, and is used to create objects of the class Moment, and thereafter call the moment_capacity() method on it with appropriate parameters.

3. test_my_script.py: It's a python script to run test on the beam_verification() using PyTest. In this script, we expect the input test case, along with the correct/expected result, to be available to us inside a text file (test_cases.txt).

4. test_cases.txt: Contains 1 mandatory test case to complete the assessment.

Note:
1. Only the relevant physical quantities are used to compute the Safety/Utilization factor. Others have been ignored.

2. The entire code has been documented with comments, and names of the variables/references have been chosen directly from the sm files to prevent any confusion.

Answer to Bonus Question:
I noticed the following issues in sm files:

1. developer_test file: Unit-mismatch, or in other words, the different physical quantities in the program have units which aren't directly compatible to be used in the equations of interest. And, they have been appropriately converted to appropriate units before/during the computation of the results.

2. moment_capacity file: An equation was not completely reduced to the simplest possible form. They have been simplified, and then implemented.
